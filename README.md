# Autonomous-multimodal-Indoor-surveillance-system-AMISS-
Autonomous multimodal surveillance system with modules consisting of audio and video analysis which can work in real-time on low hardware resources



# Video Models
After pre-processing and converting into suitable representations, the following tasks
are performed:
### Motion Detection: 
Start Video analysis on motion detection
